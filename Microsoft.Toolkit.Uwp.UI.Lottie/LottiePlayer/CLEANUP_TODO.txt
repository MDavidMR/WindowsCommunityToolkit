* Add m_issues messages about non-empty assets and anything else that should be in a Lottie file.
* Add StopPlaying - should also get called when setting a file.
* Finish the looping stuff in LottiePlayer- it currently doesn't handle having the looping state changed while playing.
* Scrubbing (maybe only in Paused mode)
* Speed (maybe only in Paused mode)
* Make a playground that uses the web version with a web control next to our version so we can compare.
* The AnimatableVector2 class probably shouldn't exist - it is a hack for the "split dimension stuff"
* Save floating point numbers as doubles, not floats.
* Remove the currentstrok, currentname, currentFill etc from JSONreader
* If a layer doesn't need visibility, do not create the contents node (use the transform node)
* There is a PathFillType, a FillRule, and another thing for Canvas*. Make them one and remove the dependency on the Win2D type except in interop.
* AnimatableTransform is inconsistently named - Animatable* means something else.
* Change the name from BM to Lottie
* Remove all references to BodyMovin and replace with Lottie
** Rename the solution and change the directory it is in.
* Remove all the TODOs - replace with release notes.
* Remove dead comments.
* Fix all the places where we ignore errors, or just report them to debug.
* Remove commented-out code
* Add a validation pass
** ParentId points to valid layers
** No circular ParentId pointers

* Remove dependency on Win2D so we can ship without needing new Win2D

* Redo the codegen as C# and let Shell convert to C++.

* Missing implementation
** Precomp
** Opacity
** All of the missing code / TODOs.
